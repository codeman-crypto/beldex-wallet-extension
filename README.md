# Beldex Wallet Extension

A non-custodial Manifest V3 browser-extension light wallet for Beldex (BDX). It runs as a
**side panel** (Chrome/Edge/Brave) or **sidebar** (Firefox), with an optional full-screen tab
mode, and exposes a `window.beldex` provider so Beldex dapps can connect with per-site approval.

It is built on the same WASM crypto core (`BeldexLibAppCpp_WASM`, from
[`beldex-core-cpp`](https://github.com/Beldex-Coin/beldex-core-cpp)) used by
[`beldex-lws-frontend`](https://github.com/Beldex-Coin/beldex-lws-frontend), consumed via the
`@bdxi/beldex-app-bridge` npm package.

                                                               window.beldex on the page
```

Key invariants:

- **The WASM runs only in the panel.** The Emscripten glue targets window contexts and MV3
  service workers are ephemeral, so all key handling and transaction signing happens there.
  The background never loads WASM.
- **Secrets at rest** are AES-256-GCM under PBKDF2-600k; decrypted secrets live only in
  `chrome.storage.session` (memory-backed, never disk) while unlocked.
- **Multi-wallet:** each wallet has its own independently-encrypted vault and password.
  Switching wallets locks the session; legacy single-vault storage migrates automatically.
- **The dapp layer holds no secrets.** `inpage.js` runs in hostile territory (the page can see
  it), so the provider is frozen and every trust decision lives in the background router.
- **All atomic math is BigInt** (`src/lib/money.ts`); floats are used only for fiat display.
- The glue resolves the wasm at `/assets/BeldexLibAppCpp_WASM.wasm`; webpack copies it out of
  `node_modules` into the build dir so it loads from the extension origin (satisfies MV3's
  no-remote-code rule; CSP includes `wasm-unsafe-eval`).

### The embind CSP patch (important)

The published WASM glue uses `new Function` (embind's `createNamedFunction` and
`craftInvokerFunction`), which MV3's CSP forbids — `unsafe-eval` is never grantable, only
`wasm-unsafe-eval`. `patches/@bdxi+beldex-app-bridge+3.0.0.patch`, applied by `patch-package`
on `postinstall`, rewrites both with eval-free equivalents (what Emscripten's
`-sDYNAMIC_EXECUTION=0` would emit). `test/bridge.test.mjs` runs under
`node --disallow-code-generation-from-strings` — the same restriction — and exercises every
bridge call the extension uses.

**If `@bdxi/beldex-app-bridge` is ever bumped, the patch must be re-created and the tests
re-run.** The long-term fix is for `beldex-core-cpp` to be rebuilt with `-sDYNAMIC_EXECUTION=0`.

## Setup

```bash
npm install                    # postinstall applies the embind patch — do not skip
npm run build                  # mainnet, both browsers
npm run build:chrome           # -> dist/
npm run build:firefox          # -> firefox/
npm run build:testnet          # testnet, both browsers
npm run build:chrome:testnet   # -> dist-testnet/
npm run build:firefox:testnet  # -> firefox-testnet/
npm run typecheck
npm test                       # CSP-strict bridge + dapp-protocol tests
npx web-ext lint --source-dir=firefox --self-hosted
```

- **Chrome/Edge/Brave:** `chrome://extensions` → enable Developer mode → **Load unpacked** → select `dist/` (or `dist-testnet/`).
- **Firefox:** `about:debugging` → This Firefox → **Load Temporary Add-on** → select `firefox/manifest.json` (or `firefox-testnet/manifest.json`).

Both targets share identical `panel.js` / `background.js` / `content.js` / `inpage.js`; only the
manifest differs (Chrome `side_panel` vs Firefox `sidebar_action` + a `gecko` id). Platform
divergence for panel open/close is isolated in `src/lib/platform.ts`.

### Network selection and `.env`

The chain is a **build-time** choice, not a runtime toggle: there is no in-app network switcher,
and only the selected network's endpoints are present in the bundle, so a build can only ever
reach the chain it was compiled for.

```bash
cp .env.example .env       # .env is gitignored; the template is committed
```

Config resolves in this order, each layer overriding the one before:

1. `src/lib/networks.json` — the checked-in defaults for each network.
2. `.env` — local overrides (`BDX_NETWORK`, `TESTNET_LWS_URL`, `MAINNET_PRICE_URL`, …).
   `process.env` beats `.env`, so CI can override without writing a file.
3. `--env network=…` on the webpack CLI — what the `:testnet` npm scripts pass.

`webpack.config.js` merges those, hands the result to `DefinePlugin` as `__BDX_NET__` (read by
`src/lib/config.ts`), and **derives** the manifest's `host_permissions` from the resolved URLs.
So pointing `TESTNET_LWS_URL` at a local server in `.env` automatically grants permission to
reach it — endpoints and permissions can't drift apart, which is the usual cause of "the fetch
fails and nothing says why". Ports are stripped from the derived patterns, since Chrome rejects
a manifest whose host permissions contain one.

Testnet builds additionally get a distinct extension name (`Beldex Wallet (Testnet)`) and Firefox
add-on id — so testnet and mainnet can be installed side by side with separate storage — plus an
amber **TESTNET** badge in the panel header.

| | mainnet | testnet |
|---|---|---|
| `NETTYPE` | 0 | 1 |
| LWS | `lwsapi.beldex.io` | `lwsapi.beldex.dev` |
| Explorer / BNS | `explorer.beldex.io` | `testnet.beldex.dev` |
| Daemon JSON-RPC | `explorer.beldex.io` | `209.126.86.93:29091` |

> **Two caveats on the testnet defaults.** The daemon RPC is plaintext `http://` — extension
> pages are secure contexts, so the browser will block that fetch as mixed content (the build
> prints a warning). It's unused today, but it needs to be `https` before anything calls it.
> And `SHOW_FIAT` is on for testnet, which quotes the *mainnet* BDX price next to coins that have
> no value; set `TESTNET_SHOW_FIAT=false` in `.env` if that's misleading in your context.

### Dapp bridge

Implements the `bdx-web3js` wire protocol (`PROTOCOL.md` v1). Discovery uses an EIP-6963-style
`beldex:requestProvider` / `beldex:announceProvider` handshake. Reads (`bdx_getState`,
`bdx_getNetwork`, `bdx_resolveBns`) are open; `bdx_getAddress` / `bdx_getBalance` require a
grant; `bdx_connect` and `bdx_sendTransaction` raise a user approval — rendered in-panel when
the panel is open, otherwise in a MetaMask-style popup anchored top-right. Sends take a global
single-flight lock shared with the panel's own send flow, and the approval card shows a real
WASM-computed fee estimate. Connected sites are listed (and revocable) in Settings and in a
bottom site bar.

## Known limitations / open items

1. **LWS trust & privacy.** The server sees your view key: it can observe incoming funds but
   can never spend. `generated_locally: true` is sent even on restore, so a never-before-seen
   address may not get a full history rescan — wiring `IMPORT_WALLET_REQUEST` is a TODO.
2. **BNS integrity.** Resolution fully trusts `explorer.beldex.io`; a compromised endpoint could
   substitute an address. Mitigation is the full-address review modal (threat model in
   `src/lib/bns.ts`). Buying BNS names would require extending `beldex-core-cpp` — the WASM
   contains the code but exposes no entry point.
3. **Subaddresses** aren't supported by the MyMonero-lineage core + LWS combination; funds sent
   to one would be invisible. Integrated addresses are the deliberate substitute. Proper support
   needs LWS-side subaddress registration (à la monero-lws) first.
4. **Firefox < 115** falls back to an in-memory session (`src/lib/sessionStore.ts`) — it works,
   but sessions die with the event page and the storage-driven panel lock doesn't fire. 115+ is
   the real baseline; the manifest's hard `strict_min_version` was removed for testing and
   **should be restored before store submission**.
5. **AMO data-collection declaration** is `["none"]` — defensible (the view key goes to the
   app's own backend), but confirm against Mozilla policy before publishing.
6. **Verify before mainnet ship.** Send end-to-end on testnet after any core/bridge bump —
   CLSAG since HF15, Bulletproofs+ since HF20.

## Trust model

Light-wallet architecture (MyMonero model): the server scans the chain with your **view key**.
It can observe incoming transactions but can never spend funds — spend keys exist only inside
the panel page, encrypted at rest with your password. Dapps never receive keys of any kind;
they get an address only after you approve the origin, and every send is user-confirmed.
